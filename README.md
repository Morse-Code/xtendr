the xtendr iOS client for app.net

xtendr is an amazingly beautiful slick app.net client for iOS, it features a fluid UI, that is completely unlike other clients with their "twitter" style app view.

Text & photo posts with "realtime-instgram style effects", live searching of hashtags, users and posts on app.net.

Graphically precise with loads of "neat touches" like a custom pull to refresh and Path-Style expanding new post button!
